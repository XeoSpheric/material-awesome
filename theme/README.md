## Theme

This folder contains all of you theming needs, from icons to wallpapers and the colors that you want to see, it is all here.

# Icons
First up is the icons folder. I would not mess with these unless you have something to add. These are the icons that you see and the left-bar and within the action menu. 

# Wallpapers
Store your wallpapers in the wallpapers folder, pretty simple, but you will still have to call them out in your theme
-todo: at a local var for wallpaper so that you don't have to remember path

# Themes
This is the part you have been waiting for. There are two parts to every theme. The default theme (which is stored in default.lua) is all the system defaults. This you should not touch unless you know what you are doing. Second is your selected theme. You will choose your selected theme in init.lua, but it will be created elsewhere. I have made the custom.lua file for you to copy and it contains more detailed notes on theming.
